Features
1. Easily create RESTful API endpoints with Spring Boot controllers
2. Define models to represent data structures used by your API.
3. Implement services to encapsulate business logic.
4. Write mock tests to verify the functionality of your controllers.
5. Example test cases provided for various scenarios.
